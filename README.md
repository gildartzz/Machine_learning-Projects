# DataCamp Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project, completed as part of the DataCamp curriculum, focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn and identify the key factors contributing to customer attrition.

## Project Structure

- `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset(s) used in this project
- `images/`: Directory for storing visualizations generated during the analysis
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project

## Key Objectives

1. Explore and preprocess the customer data
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends
3. Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn
4. Identify the most important features influencing customer churn
5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced datasets

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

## Dataset

The project uses a telecommunications customer dataset, which includes:
- Customer demographics
- Account information
- Services used
- Churn status
